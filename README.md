We have **79 explanatory variables** describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. 

The goal is to **predict the final price** of each home, and understand what are the **key variables** that affect it.

This can help: 
- Real State agencies/apps, to set the prices of the homes, by focusing on the variables that really matter. 
- Individuals that want to sell their houses, and have to decide upon a price. 
- Individuals that want to rebuild their houses to increase their value, in a way that they can use their limited budget for the factors that actually influence the price.
